# PC-Processor
## Usage
First install the deps
```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/PC-v1.0/
$ npm install
```
And then run it
```bash
$ cd ~/path/to/PC-v1.0/
$ node .
```
And yes I somehow couldn't compile it with pkg...
## Why use it
I don't know you tell me.  
Like seriously, its just basic file management and thats kindof it.  
The normal terminal is better.
## Version numbering
The normal way of showing the version number is like this:
```
PC-vMajor.Minor
```
Here, Major is where I add atleast a new set of commands and Minor is like  
adding some random commands. 
Or,
```
@Major.Minor#DayPublished
```
Here, DayPublished is, well, the day the version was published
